# Medical-App


I recently developed a desktop application using Java for the backend, JavaFX for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for my database. This app helps people make a medical appointment without the need for a phone call at the touch of a button. Both clients and doctors can remove an appointment. Customers can also provide feedback and find information about each medical specialty they can find in the clinic. There is a special section for doctors to view upcoming conferences or photos.
